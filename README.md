# Diabetes Data Analysis Project

## Overview
This project aims to analyze data related to diabetes and build a predictive model to determine the likelihood of a patient having diabetes based on various medical factors.

## Data Collection
The dataset used is the **Pima Indians Diabetes dataset**, which includes medical predictor variables and an outcome variable indicating whether the patient has diabetes.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The EDA phase involves understanding the dataset's characteristics, visualizing distributions, and identifying patterns or outliers.

## Data Cleaning
Data cleaning is performed to handle inconsistencies or missing values in the dataset.

## Machine Learning Model
A **Linear Regression** model is used as a starting point for predicting diabetes outcomes.

## Evaluation Metrics
The model's performance is assessed using accuracy, precision, and recall metrics.

## Interpretation
The impact of different features on the outcome is analyzed and interpreted.

## Usage
Instructions on how to run the project and use the predictive model are provided.

## Requirements
A list of libraries and dependencies required to run the project is included.
